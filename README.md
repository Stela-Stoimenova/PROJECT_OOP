# PROJECT_OOP
C++ project-DBMS
My SQLite engine

What is the final goal?

To implement a limited version of a very light DB management system, like SQLite implemented using C++ libraries (like iostream, string, fstream, string.h etc) without STL classes, unless explicitly required as an exception we used 'regex'. 

In the 1st phase (what we did till now)  we implemented different C++ classes that will allow you to interpret different SQL commands received from console or from a file:

The solution will be used to manage a single database - only one, with multiple tables
Accepted commands for managing the database structure are CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, DROP INDEX, DISPLAY TABLE. 

Accepted CRUD commands for managing data are INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
The accepted command for the CRUD commands is (use https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html  to get an idea)

The project is not finished till the end.
